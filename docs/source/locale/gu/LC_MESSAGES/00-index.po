"This user manual includes guidance for some of the day-to-day tasks that "
"may be required by an administrator (computer lab in-charge, teacher). It"
" is assumed that the administration has some basic knowledge of working "
"with a Linux distribution as the server is intended to be used to teach "
"the Linux subject in schools. Providing comprehensive server "
"administration guidance is outside the scope of this document."
