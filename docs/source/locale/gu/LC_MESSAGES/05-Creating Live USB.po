"When creating a bootable media intended to boot computers that only "
"support EFI booting select “isohybrid” option. This option can also boot "
"on legacy hardware so use this if you are not sure about your hardware "
"capabilities. Use of “isohybrid” option is officially recommended way of "
"creating bootable USB. Do note that this will wipe the USB device and "
"cannot be used as a normal storage media from Windows PC. Use “Ubuntu” "
"option if you wish to use the device as a storage media on Windows or "
