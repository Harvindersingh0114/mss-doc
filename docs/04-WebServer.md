The My sCool Server comes pre-configured with a ready to use web server
to help you host your content and make it available on the local
network.

Hosted content can be accessed from all clients via any web browser at
[*http://server/*](http://server/)

Each user can host their independent content at
/home/&lt;username&gt;/public\_html and it may be accessed by all at
