Participate in Localisation of the MSS Documentation
---------------------------------------------------
Herein are a few guidelines to get one started quickly with the translation effort.

1. You should have the following packages installed in your environment -
 - Python 2.x+
 - [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
 - [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/tutorial.html#install-sphinx)
 - [sphinx-autobuild](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx-autobuild#installation)
 - [sphinx-intl](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx-intl#installation)

2. Ensure you have a `build/gettext` directory path under the docs directory. You may need to create it if you have done a fresh checkout.

3. After making any changes or adding to english documentation, extract documentâ€™s translatable messages into pot files:

	`make gettext`

4. Setup/Update your locale doc by running the following in the docs folder (for e.g. herein we are doing it for Gujarati - 'gu' locale):

    `sphinx-intl update -p build/gettext/ -l gu`

5. To test changes locally, run the following and open resulting html in web browser:

    `make -e SPHINXOPTS="-D language='gu'" html`

If the modifications do not fit in any of the .rst files under https://github.com/cyberorg/mss/tree/master/docs/source then create a new .rst file and add it in https://github.com/cyberorg/mss/blob/master/docs/source/index.rst under toctree. Execute steps 3 to 4 above thereafter.

To simply translate the existing manual to a specific locale fork the project, edit the .po files from the respective locale's directory `docs/source/locale/gu/LC_MESSAGES` and submit a pull request.

NOTE: DO NOT use "Edit on Github" at http://mss-doc-gu.readthedocs.io/gu/latest/ for translating the manual to a specific locale.

Checkout [RTD documentation](http://mss-doc.readthedocs.io/) and [Translating with sphinx-intl](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/intl.html#translating-with-sphinx-intl) for a detailed guide to participate in this documentation project.
